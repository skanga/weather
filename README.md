# Weather

**Weather without the clutter.** [skanga.github.io/weather](https://skanga.github.io/weather/)

A fast, ad-free, privacy-respecting weather website. No tracking, no cookies, no bloat. Just weather.

## Why?

Weather websites are some of the most bloated pages on the internet. A typical weather page loads 6-12MB of JavaScript, tracking scripts, and ads just to show you the temperature. This app loads its core page under 350KB - that's 10-20x lighter.

## Features

- Current conditions with feels-like, humidity, dew point, wind, gusts, UV index, and air quality
- 24-hour hourly forecast
- 10-day forecast with interactive charts (temperature, humidity/cloud/pressure, precipitation, wind)
- Animated weather radar with play/pause and speed controls
- Sunrise, sunset, solar noon, moonrise, moonset, and moon phase
- Severe weather alerts: NWS direct for US, optional OpenWeatherMap One Call key for non-US
- Weather summary sentence generated from forecast data
- Dark mode (auto-detects OS preference, manual toggle)
- Fahrenheit/Celsius and 12H/24H toggles (auto-detects from country)
- Optional layout customization - reorder, resize, minimize, or hide sections
- Bookmarkable URLs with direct lat/lon for instant loading
- Installable as a PWA (Progressive Web App)
- International postal code support (60+ countries)
- Current-location lookup via browser GPS permission
- Zero cookies, zero tracking, zero analytics

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Plain HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript - no frameworks, no bundler, no npm dependencies at runtime
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages (free)
- **Weather data:** [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/) (free, no API key)
- **Radar:** [RainViewer API](https://www.rainviewer.com/api.html) (free) + [CartoDB](https://carto.com/basemaps/) map tiles + NoAdsRadar Cloud Run future-cast tiles for the contiguous US
- **Alerts:** [NWS API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) (free, US only) + optional user-provided OpenWeatherMap One Call API key for non-US alerts
- **Air quality:** [Open-Meteo Air Quality API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/air-quality-api) (free)
- **Postal codes:** [Zippopotam](https://api.zippopotam.us/) (free, 60+ countries)

## Running Locally

No build step is required to serve the site. Just serve the files:

```bash
npx http-server . -p 8080
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080`.

## How It Works

1. User searches a city/postal code or clicks **Use current location**
2. Geocoding converts searches to lat/lon coordinates (Open-Meteo for cities, Zippopotam for postal codes); GPS uses the browser Geolocation API directly
3. All weather APIs are called in parallel from the browser to remote backends & cloud services
4. Sections render progressively as each API responds
5. User preferences (layout, units, theme, optional OpenWeatherMap key) are saved in localStorage

GPS notes:

- Forecasts work worldwide because Open-Meteo accepts raw GPS coordinates.
- US GPS locations are checked against `api.weather.gov/points` for city/state, imperial defaults, and NWS alerts.
- Non-US GPS locations may show as "Current Location" if no city/country is known. Non-US severe alerts require the user's own OpenWeatherMap One Call API key in Settings; without it, the app shows a non-US alerts unavailable message.

## Cost

- **Hosting:** Free (GitHub Pages)
- **APIs:** Free (Open-Meteo, RainViewer, NWS, Zippopotam); non-US alerts require the user's own OpenWeatherMap key; NoAdsRadar uses the project's Cloud Run service
- **Total:** $0/year
